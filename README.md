# Welcome to Simple Inventory

This project was started to practice OOP in python and familiarize myself with
basic OOP syntax. 

The entire thing is based on the CLI, that is, it does not have a GUI (graphics user
interface).

Some things to know:
- I am a complete beginner so do not expect anything too much from this project.
There are no docstrings as of now (3rd Sep '25) 
- Alot of the functions are a mess and error handling isn't done very well.
- There are no tests, so new error may appear.
- I used uv in this project since I wanted practice with this as well.

I will update this if I continue to work on this project.
